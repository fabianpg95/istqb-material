- [x] **Assessment** of the **maturity of the own organization**, its strengths and weaknesses
- [x] **Identification** of **opportunities** for an improved test process supported by tools
- [x] **Understanding** of the **technologies** used by the test object(s), in order to select a tool that is
compatible with that technology
- [x] **Understanding** the build and continuous integration tools already in use within the organization, in
order to ensure tool compatibility and integration
- [x] **Evaluation** of the tool against clear requirements and objective criteria
- [x] **Consideration** of whether or not the tool is available for a free trial period (and for how long)

- [x] Gaining in-depth knowledge about the tool, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses
- [x] Evaluating how the tool fits with existing processes and practices, and determining what would
need to change
- [x] Deciding on standard ways of using, managing, storing, and maintaining the tool and the test
work products (e.g., deciding on naming conventions for files and tests, selecting coding
standards, creating libraries and defining the modularity of test suites)
- [x] Assessing whether the benefits will be achieved at reasonable cost
- [x] Understanding the metrics that you wish the tool to collect and report, and configuring the tool to
ensure these metrics can be captured and reported

- [x] Rolling out the tool to the rest of the organization incrementally
- [x] Adapting and improving processes to fit with the use of the tool
- [x] Providing training, coaching, and mentoring for tool users
- [x] Defining guidelines for the use of the tool (e.g., internal standards for automation)
- [x] Implementing a way to gather usage information from the actual use of the tool
- [x] Monitoring tool use and benefits
- [x] Providing support to the users of a given tool
- [x] Gathering lessons learned from all users
