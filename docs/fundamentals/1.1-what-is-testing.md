## **What is testing**?

*"Software testing is a way to asses the quality of the software and to reduce the risk of software failures in operation."*

    ISTQB definition:
    *"Testing is the process consisting of all lifecycle activities (static and dynamic) concerned with planning preparation and evaluation pf a component system and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements for purpose and to detect defects."*

A common misconception of testing is that it only consists of running tests, executing the software and checking the results.
However, test activities are before and after test execution.
