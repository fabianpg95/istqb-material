## 5.3.1 - **Metrics used in Testing**

### **Definition**

* The purpose of test monitoring is to gather information and provide feedback and visibility about test
activities. 

Information to be monitored may be collected manually or automatically and should be used to
assess test progress and to measure whether the test exit criteria, or the testing tasks associated with an
Agile project's definition of done, are satisfied, such as meeting the targets for coverage of product risks,
requirements, or acceptance criteria.

* Test control describes any guiding or corrective actions taken as a result of information and metrics
gathered and (possibly) reported. Actions may cover any test activity and may affect any other software
lifecycle activity.

**Examples of test control actions include:**

- [x] Re-prioritizing tests when an identified risk occurs (e.g., software delivered late)
- [x] Changing the test schedule due to availability or unavailability of a test environment or other
resources
- [x] Re-evaluating whether a test item meets an entry or exit criterion due to rework

## 5.3.2 - **Purposes, Contents, and Audience for Test Reports**

### **Purposes**

The purpose of test reporting is to summarize and communicate test activity information, both during and
at the end of a test activity (e.g., a test level).

During test monitoring and control, the test manager regularly issues test progress reports for
stakeholders. In addition to content common to test progress reports and test summary reports, typical
test progress reports may also include:

- [x] The status of the test activities and progress against the test plan
- [x] Factors impeding progress
- [x] Testing planned for the next reporting period
- [x] The quality of the test object

### **Typical test summary reports may include:**

- [x] Summary of testing performed
- [x] Information on what occurred during a test period
- [x] Deviations from plan, including deviations in schedule, duration, or effort of test activities
- [x] Status of testing and product quality with respect to the exit criteria or definition of done
- [x] Factors that have blocked or continue to block progress
- [x] Metrics of defects, test cases, test coverage, activity progress, and resource consumption.
- [x] Residual risks
- [x] Reusable test work products produced

### **Content and Audience**

<img src="../../images/istqb/test_management/content.jpeg" alt="Content" width="380" height="120"/>

* The contents of a test report will vary depending on the project, the organizational requirements, and the
software development lifecycle.

* The type and amount of information that should be included for a
technical audience or a test team may be different from what would be included in an executive summary
report. In the first case, detailed information on defect types and trends may be important. 

* In the latter
case, a high-level report *(e.g., a status summary of defects by priority, budget, schedule, and test
conditions passed/failed/not tested)* may be more appropriate.
