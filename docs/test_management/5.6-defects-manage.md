* During the defect management process, some of the reports may turn out to describe false positives, not
actual failures due to defects. For example, a test may fail when a network connection is broken or times
out. 

* This behavior does not result from a defect in the test object, but is an anomaly that needs to be
investigated. Testers should attempt to minimize the number of false positives reported as defects.

### **A defect report filed during dynamic testing typically includes:** 

- [x] An identifier
- [x] A title and a short summary of the defect being reported
- [x] Date of the defect report, issuing organization, and author
- [x] Identification of the test item (configuration item being tested) and environment
- [x] The development lifecycle phase(s) in which the defect was observed
- [x] A description of the defect to enable reproduction and resolution, including logs, database dumps,
screenshots, or recordings (if found during test execution)
- [x] Expected and actual results
- [x] Scope or degree of impact (severity) of the defect on the interests of stakeholder(s)
- [x] Urgency/priority to fix 
- [x] References, including the test case that revealed the problem
- [x] State of the defect

**Defects may be reported in this scenarios:**

software product.

* Also, for issues in code or working systems, or in any type of
documentation including requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria, development documents,
test documents, user manuals, or installation guides.
