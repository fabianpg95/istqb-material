* Testing tasks may be done by people in a specific testing role, or by people in another role (e.g.,
customers). A certain degree of independence often makes the tester more effective at finding defects
due to differences between the author’s and the tester’s cognitive biases.

* For most types of projects, it is usually best to have multiple test levels, with some of these levels handled
by independent testers. Developers should participate in testing, especially at the lower levels, so as to
exercise control over the quality of their own work. 

**Degrees of independence in testing include the following (from low level of independence to high level):**

- [x] No independent testers; the only form of testing available is developers testing their own code
- [x] Independent developers or testers within the development teams or the project team; this could
be developers testing their colleagues’ products
- [x] Independent test team or group within the organization, reporting to project management or
executive management
- [x] Independent testers from the business organization or user community, or with specializations in
specific test types such as usability, security, performance, regulatory/compliance, or portability
- [x] Independent testers external to the organization, either working on-site (in-house) or off-site
(outsourcing)

The way in which independence of testing is implemented varies depending on the software development
lifecycle model.
